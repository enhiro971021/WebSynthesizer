# WebSynthesizer

Simple browser-based synthesizer powered by [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io).

## Features
- Play notes with on-screen keys or the computer keyboard (`A W S E D F T G Y H U J`).
- Switch between sine, square, triangle, and saw waveforms.
- Shape the sound with ADSR envelope controls.
- Adjust output volume plus low-pass filter cutoff and resonance.

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. Interact with any control to unlock audio playback (required by browser autoplay policies).
3. Jam!

No build step requiredâ€”the project is completely static.
